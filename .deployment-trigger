# ROI Labs Chatbot Training - Deployment Trigger

Deployment timestamp: 2025-06-15T05:18:30Z

## ✅ CACHE BREAKING COMPLETED

### Changes Applied:
1. 🔧 **Modified `frontend/src/main.tsx`** - Added build timestamp and console.log
2. 🎨 **Modified `frontend/src/App.tsx`** - Added theme logging and version comment  
3. 🗑️ **Removed simple HTML dashboard** - Forces React-only serving
4. ⚙️ **Improved server detection logic** - Better React dashboard detection

### Expected Docker Build Result:
```
[frontend-builder 6/6] RUN npm run build  ← Should NOT show #CACHED
COPY --from=frontend-builder ./public/dashboard  ← Fresh React build
```

### Expected Runtime Result:
- Console logs: "🚀 ROI Labs Dashboard iniciando..."
- Console logs: "🎨 ROI Labs Dashboard - Theme: Light"  
- React dashboard with navigation tabs
- Modern UI with crawling forms, search, history

**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** 🚀
**Expected Result**: Modern React Dashboard
**Monitor**: Check build logs for cache breaking success
