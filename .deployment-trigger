# ROI Labs Chatbot Training - Deployment Trigger

Deployment timestamp: 2025-06-15T02:30:00Z

## Changes Made

### âœ… Fixed Dashboard Issue
- **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: The Easypanel deployment was serving the simple health check page instead of the full React dashboard
- **ROOT CAUSE**: The server was serving `public/index.html` (simple version) instead of the built React app from `public/dashboard/`
- **SOLUTION**: Modified `src/app.js` to:
  - Detect if React dashboard is built and available
  - Serve React dashboard from `/public/dashboard/` when available
  - Fallback to simple HTML dashboard if React build not found
  - Added proper static file serving for React assets
  - Added SPA routing support for React Router

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result
After this deployment, you should see:
- **Modern React Dashboard** with all features from your images
- **Tabs Navigation**: Novo Crawling, Buscar ConteÃºdo, HistÃ³rico
- **Advanced Forms**: URL input, max pages, depth, delay settings
- **Real-time Statistics**: Charts, metrics, progress tracking
- **Search Functionality**: Content search with results
- **History Table**: Complete crawling history with actions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### ðŸ”„ Build Process
The Docker build will:
1. **Build Frontend**: `npm run build` in `/frontend` â†’ creates `/frontend/dist`
2. **Copy to Backend**: `/frontend/dist` â†’ `/public/dashboard`
3. **Serve React App**: Server detects React build and serves it on `/`

### ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions
1. Easypanel will auto-detect this change
2. Build will include React frontend compilation
3. Server will automatically serve the React dashboard
4. Visit https://bot.roilabs.com.br to see the new interface
