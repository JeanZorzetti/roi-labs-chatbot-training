**Last Update:** 2025-06-15 05:41:00 UTC
**Trigger ID:** FRONTEND_FIX_20250615_054100
**Changes:** 
- Enhanced Dockerfile with better error handling and debug logs
- Fixed frontend build process for React dashboard

2. **Backend Build**: Node.js Express server preparation  
3. **Production**: Combined container with frontend served from `/public/dashboard/`

### Expected Result:
- ✅ React dashboard should be available at `/`
- ✅ API endpoints should be available at `/api/*`
- ✅ Health check should show dashboard availability

### Debug Information:
- Build logs will show detailed frontend compilation steps
- Production stage will verify frontend files are in correct location
- Health check endpoint will indicate dashboard status
