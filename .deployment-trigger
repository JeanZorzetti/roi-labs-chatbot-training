✅ FIXED ISSUES:
- Added type definitions and converters for crawling jobs
- Fixed incompatibility between CrawlingJob and Job interfaces  
- Added completedAt property to Job interface for JobsTable compatibility
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors

✅ CHANGES MADE:
1. Created frontend/src/types/crawling.ts with proper type definitions
2. Added conversion functions: convertCrawlingJobToJob() and convertCrawlingJobsToJobs()
3. Updated Job interface to include all properties used by components
4. Maintained compatibility between API responses and UI components

✅ EXPECTED RESULT:
- TypeScript compilation should now pass without errors
- Build process should complete successfully  
- Deploy should proceed normally
- All crawling functionality should work properly

Build should now succeed with proper type safety!
